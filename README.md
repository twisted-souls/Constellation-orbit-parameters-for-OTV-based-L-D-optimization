This repository contains all the orbital parameters of the constellations used for the numerical simulation and experiment of the paper "Bi-objective optimization of OTV-based launch and deployment process for LEO constellation" submitted to the Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

Each .mat file is an N*6 matrix, where N is the constellation's satellite number. These six columns of data represent the semi-major axis, eccentricity, orbital inclination, right ascension of the ascending node, argument of perigee, and mean anomaly.
